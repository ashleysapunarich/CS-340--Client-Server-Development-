# CS-340--Client-Server-Development-
In Project One, I developed a modular CRUD Python module to manage Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations with MongoDB. This module became the foundation for Project Two, where I connected dashboard widgets to live database queries. By designing the module with clear function boundaries, descriptive naming, and robust error handling, I ensured that the code was maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Each function accepted flexible parameters, which allowed me to reuse the same logic across different dashboard components without rewriting code. This approach made testing easier and enabled me to scale the dashboard as new features were added.

Working this way had several advantages. The modular design allowed me to isolate and test each CRUD operation independently, which improved reliability and reduced debugging time. It also made the dashboard more resilient to changes, since updates to the database logic could be made in one place without affecting the entire application. In the future, this CRUD module could be repurposed for other projects, such as admin dashboards, backend APIs, or data migration scripts—any scenario that requires structured interaction with a MongoDB database.

When approaching the dashboard and database requirements for Grazioso Salvare, I followed a structured problem-solving strategy. First, I carefully reviewed the client’s goals and rubric to identify key features like rescue type filtering, location mapping, and branded visuals. I then broke the project into manageable components: CRUD logic, dashboard layout, filtering callbacks, and chart rendering. I built each part incrementally, testing MongoDB queries and Dash callbacks before integrating them. This iterative approach helped me catch errors early and refine the user experience. Compared to previous assignments, this project demanded a deeper focus on usability, branding, and real-world complexity, which pushed me to think more like a client-focused engineer.

Looking ahead, I plan to use several techniques to create databases that meet future client requests. These include implementing schema validation to ensure data consistency, adding role-based access for secure dashboards, and using pagination and indexing for large datasets. I also see the value in using mock data and unit tests to validate logic before deployment. These strategies will help me build scalable, secure, and user-friendly systems that align with client needs.

Computer scientists solve problems by designing systems that are efficient, scalable, and intuitive. In this project, my work helped Grazioso Salvare visualize their data, make informed decisions, and streamline operations. The dashboard allowed staff to track rescue operations by type, location, and urgency, while the CRUD module enabled real-time updates to the database. This kind of software empowers organizations to operate more effectively, demonstrating how thoughtful design and engineering can directly support meaningful missions.
